# Error Handling & Classification Improvements

## Overview

The waste sorting app now includes comprehensive error handling and better classification for edge cases.

## Key Improvements

### 1. API Error Handling with Retry Logic

**Problem Solved:** API errors like "529 Overloaded" would cause the app to fail completely.

**Solution:**
- Automatic retry (up to 3 attempts) for transient errors like API overload
- Exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s delays between retries)
- User-friendly error messages instead of technical errors

**Handled Error Types:**
- **529 Overloaded:** Automatically retries, shows "AI service is currently overloaded" after 3 attempts
- **429 Rate Limit:** Shows "Too many requests. Please wait a moment"
- **401 Authentication:** Shows "API key is invalid"
- **JSON Parse Errors:** Shows "Could not understand the AI response"
- **Network Errors:** Shows "An unexpected error occurred"

### 2. UNKNOWN Classification Category

**Problem Solved:** AI couldn't classify ambiguous or unclear images.

**Solution:**
- Added "UNKNOWN" as a fourth category
- AI uses this when:
  - Image doesn't clearly show waste
  - Classification confidence is very low
  - Items don't fit into the three main categories
  - Image quality is too poor

**Visual Styling:**
- Gray gradient background
- ❓ question mark icon
- Clear explanation in reasoning field

### 3. Enhanced Frontend Error Display

**Improvements:**
- User-friendly messages instead of technical error codes
- Clear instructions on what to do next
- Errors don't break the UI flow
- Users can retry immediately after an error

### 4. Validation & Safety

**Backend Validation:**
- Validates response structure from AI
- Ensures all required fields exist
- Validates category values
- Handles malformed JSON gracefully

**Frontend Validation:**
- Checks for empty items_detected arrays
- Shows "No items detected" when appropriate
- Handles missing fields without crashing

## Error Message Examples

| Error Type | User Sees |
|------------|-----------|
| API Overloaded | "The AI service is currently overloaded. Please try again in a few moments." |
| Rate Limited | "Too many requests. Please wait a moment before trying again." |
| Invalid API Key | "API key is invalid. Please check the server configuration." |
| Network Error | "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again." |
| Poor Image Quality | Category: UNKNOWN, "Could not confidently classify this image" |

## Testing Error Scenarios

### Test API Overload (529)
The app will automatically retry 3 times before showing an error message.

### Test Unknown Classification
Try these scenarios to see UNKNOWN category:
1. Take a blurry photo
2. Take a photo with multiple mixed waste types
3. Take a photo of non-waste items
4. Take a photo in very poor lighting

### Test Network Errors
1. Disconnect from internet
2. Try to analyze an image
3. Should see: "An unexpected error occurred"

## Code Structure

### Backend (app.py)
```
classify_waste()
├── Input validation
├── Retry loop (3 attempts)
│   ├── Call Anthropic API
│   ├── Parse JSON response
│   └── Validate response
├── Error handling
│   ├── APIStatusError (529, 429, 401)
│   ├── JSONDecodeError
│   └── General Exception
└── Return result or user-friendly error
```

### Frontend (index.html)
```
analyzeBtn.click()
├── Show loading spinner
├── Fetch /classify endpoint
├── Check for data.error
│   └── Use data.user_message if available
├── Display result or error
└── Re-enable analyze button
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience:** Clear messages instead of cryptic errors
2. **Resilience:** Automatic retries for transient failures
3. **Transparency:** Users understand what went wrong
4. **Flexibility:** Handles edge cases gracefully
5. **Debugging:** Detailed error logging on server side

## Future Improvements (Optional)

- [ ] Add request timeout configuration
- [ ] Implement client-side image validation (file size, format)
- [ ] Add analytics to track error rates
- [ ] Implement offline mode with cached responses
- [ ] Add option for users to report misclassifications
